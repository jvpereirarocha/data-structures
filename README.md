## About this repository
This repository was created to show my studies about Data Structures and those important concepts

### Instructions to run
1. Install Python 3.12
2. Create a virtualenv with this version of Python. In linux, we can create the virtualenv with the command `python -m venv <path of virtualenv> <name of virtualenv>`
3. Active the virtualenv. In linux we use `source <path of virtualenv>/<name of virtualenv>/bin/activate`

   **PS:** Ignore the `<>` and use something like `/home/mypath/myvirtualenv`
5. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the project requirements
6. Run `pytest tests` to run all the tests
